JavaScript
[x] Use classes and functions to organize your code into reusable pieces.
[x] Translate JSON responses into JavaScript model objects using ES6 class or constructor function syntax.
[x] Use ES6 features when appropriate (e.g. arrow functions, let & const, rest and spread syntax).

Rails

[x] Well-named variables and methods
[x] Short, single-purpose methods

Git

[x] Add meaningful messages to your commits. When you look back at your commits with git log, the messages should describe each change.
